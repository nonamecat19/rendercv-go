# Port ledger

Living state of the rendercv-go port. **Updated only by the merge owner, after
`rendercv-parity-verifier` reports.** Never edited by a porter as part of a feature commit.

Upstream target: `third_party/rendercv` @ `v2.8` (`2eba248`)

Legend: `—` not started · `spec` spec written · `red` tests written, failing ·
`wip` implementation in progress · `green` all its conformance cases pass

## Iterations

| # | Subsystem | Spec | Status | Conformance cases passing |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Bootstrap (layout, AGENTS.md, submodule, agents, skills, CI) | — | green | n/a |
| 1 | Conformance harness (corpus, gengolden, helpers) | [001](001-conformance-harness/spec.md) | green | n/a (42 cases red by design) |
| 2 | YAML reader + core model (RenderCVModel, CV, Section) | [002](002-yaml-and-core-model/spec.md) | green (with cut scope, see below) | n/a (gated on unit tests, spec §7.2) |
| 3 | Entry types (9) | — | — | 0 / 9 |
| 4 | Validation-error parity | — | — | 0 |
| 5 | JSON Schema generator | — | — | 0 / 1 |
| 6 | Design & themes (9) + Lua-scripted custom themes (D-002) | — | — | 0 / 9 |
| 7 | Locale (English + 21 catalogs) + date formatting | — | — | 0 / 22 |
| 8 | Templater (pongo2 env, filters, markdown→typst, processors) | — | — | 0 |
| 9 | Typst renderer (`.typ` emission) | — | — | 0 / 18 |
| 10 | wazero + WASI typst → PDF, then PNG | — | — | 0 |
| 11 | Markdown + HTML renderers | — | — | 0 / 4 |
| 12 | CLI (`new`, `render`, `create-theme`, overrides, watcher) | — | — | 0 |
| 13 | Parity closeout (sample generator, version, error handler, packaging) | — | — | 0 |

## Parity axes

| Axis | Gate command | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — artifacts byte-identical | `just test-parity` | measurable, 0/15 cases passing |
| 2 — CLI surface | `just test-parity` | measurable, 0/20 cases passing |
| 3 — JSON Schema | `just test-parity`, `just schema-diff` | measurable, failing |
| 4 — validation errors | `just test-parity` | measurable, 0/7 cases passing |

PDF content comparison (spec §1.2) is not yet measurable — it lands with iteration 10.

## Stretch goals (not gates)

- [ ] PNG pixel-level comparison (depends on the WASI typst font set — see D-006)
- [ ] Public `pkg/rendercv` API frozen and semver'd
- [ ] Cross-compiled release artifacts (linux/darwin/windows × amd64/arm64)

## Cut scope

Anything dropped from an iteration is recorded here with the reason, per `AGENTS.md` §10.2.

### Iteration 2

Verified by `rendercv-parity-verifier` in a fresh context. Everything below is carried into
iteration 3's spec as an open item; nothing here is a silent divergence.

1. **Coordinate columns diverge from ruamel in two shapes the T8 fixture cannot see.** A key
   with a null or empty value reports column 1 rather than the key's own indent
   (`internal/schema/yamlreader/build.go`), and a flow-sequence element reports the first value
   token rather than the `[`. Measured against upstream: 33/232 paths differ on
   `examples/John_Doe_ClassicTheme_CV.yaml`, 50/388 on
   `tests/schema/testdata/test_pydantic_error_handling/expected_errors.yaml`. **Lines match
   everywhere**, and spec §6.7 says only line numbers reach users, so nothing user-visible is
   affected yet — but `expected_errors.yaml` is iteration 4's import, so this must be fixed
   there, together with extending the fixture to cover both shapes.
2. **`models.Validate` does not call `cv.Validate`.** `models` owns `ValidationContext` and the
   path types, which `cv` imports, so the edge would cycle. Closing it needs those two types
   moved to a leaf package — a `plan.md` layout change, deferred to iteration 3 rather than
   made unreviewed at the tail of this one. Everything *inside* `cv` is wired (commit
   `fd33d82`).
3. **`phone` formatting (spec §3.49) is not implemented.** `+905419999999` does not serialize to
   `+90-541-999-99-99`; only the `tel:` strip is done. Spec §8 lists this as an acceptance
   criterion while spec §7 assigns phone formatting to iteration 4 — **the spec contradicts
   itself and iteration 4 must resolve which is right.**
4. **T7's no-op regression test over the submodule YAML corpus was never written.** The verifier
   ran it by hand — 64/64 files identical with and without `dealias` — so the transform is
   sound, but nothing in the suite guards it. `noalias_test.go` also asserts tokens where
   `tasks.md` required the parsed tree; the tree-level assertions now live in
   `yamlreader_test.go` (commit `f91da06`).
5. **T10's scalar corpus is hand-written, not generated.** `tools/yamlprobe` still emits only the
   five coordinate documents, so `resolve_test.go` states Go-side expectations rather than
   deriving them from upstream. Behavior was differentially verified as correct.
6. **§4.12's "mixed section" and "entry problems" criteria are tested through an injected
   validator**, because the concrete entry types are iteration 3's. They must be re-checked
   against real types when those land.

Two process failures in this iteration's history, recorded rather than rewritten:

- `1befa1e` bundles T9, T10 and T11 in one commit, against `AGENTS.md` §7.
- T8's coordinate test landed in `65aaa49`, *after* the T9 implementation it was supposed to
  precede, inverting the red-before-green rule of `AGENTS.md` §4.

## Log

| Date | Event |
|---|---|
| 2026-08-06 | Repo bootstrapped; upstream pinned at v2.8; parity contract written. |
| 2026-08-06 | Iteration 1 green: 42-case corpus, gengolden, 351 golden files, red parity suite. |
| 2026-08-06 | Iteration 2 green with cut scope: reader, binder, overlay merge, cv, entry bases, sections. Conformance suite unchanged (42 red by design). Six items carried to iteration 3. |
| 2026-08-06 | Parity bug found and fixed: section-title capitalization used `unicode.ToTitle`, which is rune-to-rune and cannot express Python's `str.capitalize()` (`ßeta` → `Sseta`, `ﬁle` → `File`). The failing rows had been dropped from the test table rather than reported. |
